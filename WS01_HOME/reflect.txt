FYI: QUESTIONS ARE IN WS1.PDF

Ans1: A namespace is an container created to hold unique identifiers and symbols. 
      An identifier defined in a namespace is associated only with that namespace thereby removing naming conflict.

Ans2: While creating an applicaton its impossible to fit thousands of lines of code under one file so by creating header 
      files we can store function's defination which can directly be used into a program by just including that header 
      file.

Ans3: While including some header files we are actually telling  compiler to copy the contents of header file into some
      another file mostly .cpp file so it's enough to compile everything at once also it slows down the executing speed 
      because it compiles single line multiple times.

Ans4: So that the purpose of seperating the source code into small readable and sensible code isn't lost. Also all the 
      above copying stuff.

Ans5: While debugging its easier to know which part is corrupted. It increases the readibility and understandibility of code.
      Also by breaking the code into smaller pieces the code is more maintainable, more testable, more resusable and the most
      important is that we don't have to think about everything at once.

Ans6: I learnt how to separate code into small modules, all stuff about header files and including and reusing them. Most 
      important: the namespaces and purpose. Few things about object oriented programming too.


QUIZ 1 REFLECTION:

Ans1: A namespace is an container created to hold unique identifiers and symbols. 

Ans7: Encapsulation: The wrapping up of data i.e. functions and members into single unit to protect them from misuse and
      and interference.
